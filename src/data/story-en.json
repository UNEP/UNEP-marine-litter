Plastics can provide important benefits, from life-saving medical devices to safe and long-life food storage. However, unnecessary and avoidable plastics, particularly single-use packaging and disposable items, are polluting our planet at alarming rates.

Plastics don’t biodegrade (decompose naturally in a way that’s not harmful to the environment). Instead, they break down over time into ever smaller pieces known as microplastics and nanoplastics, particles ranging from 5 millimeters long to less than a few nanometers in size, which can have significant adverse impacts that are difficult to quantify. Some of the most heartbreaking images attest to the harm it inflicts on marine animals."},{"p":"Impacts to marine life range from physical or chemical harm to individual animals, to wider effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

Not only do the toxins already found in plastics affect the ocean food web but plastic pieces are known to soak up pollutants that flow off the land into the sea, including pharmaceutical and industrial waste. The toxicity can transfer through the food chain as marine species eat and are eaten. There is also a growing concern about non-native species hitching a ride across the ocean on floating trash into foreign seas and soil, such as algae, mollusks and barnacles, which can invade and degrade distant aquatic environments and species. It would be remiss not to mention that most plastic garbage in the ocean eventually sinks to the seabed like a submerged trash pile, smothering coral reefs and seafloor marine life below, explains the assessment."}]},{"type":"text","head":"Harm to Humans","text":[{"p":"Humans are also at risk from marine plastic pollution. Environmental health is inextricably linked to human health. The pervasiveness of microplastics across our planet raises serious concerns for people’s safety. New research shows that people are inhaling microplastics through the air, consuming them through food and water and even absorbing them through the skin. Microplastics have even been found within our lungs, livers, spleen, and kidneys."}]},{"type":"small-illo","illo":"small-illos-04","align":"center"},{"type":"text","text":[{"p":"The full extent of the impacts to human health are still unknown since the research is nascent. There is, however, substantial evidence that plastics-associated chemicals, such as methyl mercury, plasticizers and flame retardants, can enter the body and are linked to health concerns, especially in women. Scientists also believe that some of the common chemicals found in plastics, such as bisphenol A, phthalates, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), could leach into the body. These chemicals have been linked to endocrine disruption, developmental disorders, reproductive abnormalities and cancer. That’s reason enough for a precautionary approach to be adopted."},{"p":"The impacts of plastics pollution aren’t felt equally around the world. Wealthier countries produce more plastic waste, which all too frequently flows into less developed countries where waste management is the least sophisticated. Recycling helps reduce plastics production and plastic waste. However, recycling rates remain low worldwide. Even economically advanced countries like the US are only at 9 percent. Communities in developing countries are the least capable of managing the environmental, health, social and cultural burden of plastic pollution due to a lack of government support or funds. That means women, children, waste workers, coastal communities, Indigenous Peoples and people who depend on the ocean feel the impacts more intensely, particularly when moving or burning mismanaged waste. It also means these economies suffer as they’re suffocated by plastics. In 2018, China banned the import of most plastic waste to help improve the environment, air quality and economy within its own borders since most of the trash wound up in landfills or in waterways and soil."},{"p":"Marine plastics negatively impact the ability of myriad ecosystems to provide the basic benefits that humans both enjoy and take for granted, from clean water, to productive aquaculture and fisheries, pest and disease control, climate regulation, heritage and recreation. According to the assessment, marine plastics pollution reduces valuable marine ecosystem service by at least US$500 to US$2,500 billion each year, and that’s not including other social and economic losses like tourism and shipping. The direct economic losses to coastal and maritime industries, such as fisheries and shipping, are significant. In the Mediterranean, these losses have been estimated at close to US$138 million per year, and US$10.8 billion, a nearly ten-fold increase compared to 2009. However, these losses aren’t well reported, and the true costs of plastics pollution on human, environmental, social health are still being discovered."}]},{"type":"pill","short":"An off ratio of male and female turtles?","long":"Microplastics can raise the temperature of the sand on beaches where sea turtles nest.

Not everyone knows that plastic is produced from oil, a fossil fuel. The more plastics we make, the more fossil fuel required, the more we intensify the climate crisis in a continual negative feedback loop. Also, plastic products create greenhouse gas emissions across their whole lifecycle. For example, if no action is taken, greenhouse gas emissions from the production, recycling and incineration of plastics could account for 19 per cent of the Paris Agreement’s total allowable emissions in 2040 if we’re on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius."},{"p":"In recent years, there has been an increased urgency to protect the ocean and seas to tackle climate change. The ocean is the planet’s largest carbon sink on earth, storing as much as 90 per cent of the additional heat that carbon emissions have trapped in our atmosphere and one third of the additional carbon dioxide generated since the industrial revolution. Absorbing large quantities of carbon has slowed the visible impacts of a warming planet – but also accelerated catastrophic effects below the water’s surface – a warming, acidifying and chemically imbalanced ocean."},{"p":"Carbon is sequestered in every component of the ocean, especially mangroves, seagrass, corals and salt marshes. Healthy coastal mangrove forests store more carbon per unit area than almost any other forest on Earth. The more damage we do to our ocean and coastal areas, the harder it is for these ecosystems to both offset and remain resilient to climate change."},{"p":"Interestingly, a recent study on marine plastics pollution by GRID-Arendal, a UNEP partner, indicates that the four coastal ecosystems that store the most carbon and serve as natural barriers against rising seas and storms – mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes and coral reefs – are also those closest to rivers with high concentrations of plastic waste.
